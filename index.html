    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> I am Cynthia! I have started to learn web development because, for one, I'm interested in it and two, there is a great need for a
        learning platform like Udemy in our native language, especially for students who can't afford higher education. This is the reason I'm pursuing
        this skill to create something that will help many students across the nation. I'm learning to become a web developer in addition to
        training young leaders to reach their full potential in many aspects of their lives.</p>
